INTRODUCTION
------------
The Schedule application displays and allows a company to plan
and schedule projects, tasks and individual assignments.
These tasks and assignments can be assigned to any available
employee, whom are displayed during task management and 
assignment creation.
The application allows for employee expansion and deletion.

The program features the registration of time worked on an
assignment along with the registration of absence in terms of
sickness or vacation.

The timekeeping system embedded within the program is based on
the Calendar and GregorianCalendar classes from the standard
import java.util library.


SYSTEM NAVIGATION
-----------------
When lauching the application for the first time the GUI will
be run and you will be greeted by the welcome panel.
Here you can log in using a 4-digit initials log in code.

The system has built-in 3 employees, two of which are admini-
strators and have full control over the system, including the 
removal of employees. The last employee is the Absence Manager.
The Absence Manager is in charge of monitoring and registering
the absence of employees.

The initials of the built-in employees are as follows:
  
		 Initials  |        Name        |   Role
		------------------------------------------
		  "seny"   |  Sebastian Nyholm  |   admin
		  "luvi"   |  Lukas Villumsen   |   admin
		  "abma"   |  Absence Manager   |  absence

Logging in as "seny" and you arrive
